  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="about-content">
    <p>
      Hi there!👋 I’m Jeffrey Njenga, a passionate and detail-oriented software developer with a love for turning ideas into reality through code. 
      Hailing from Nairobi, Kenya, my journey into tech began with a simple question: *"How do things work behind the screen?"*
       That curiosity sparked a lifelong passion for building innovative solutions and creating seamless digital experiences.   
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I’m honing my skills in html, css and javascript, while still expanding my skills in fullstack web development,
      with a focus on crafting clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications. Whether it’s building dynamic websites, 
      automating workflows, or exploring cutting-edge technologies, I’m always eager to learn and grow.  
      I believe in the power of technology to transform lives, and I’m excited to contribute to that change. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from coding, I enjoy playing various sports such as football, basketball and golf. I also like engaging activities like 
      conserving the environment, swimming and playing various musical instruments. Nonetheless, I enjoy travelling various parts of the world
      as I enjoy what mother nature has to offer and also exploring different cultures is interesting to me.

    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s connect and create something extraordinary together!🌟
